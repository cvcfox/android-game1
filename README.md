# Scribble Pals

Scribble Pals is a gentle drawing-and-prompt game designed for toddlers. Kids can doodle freely with chunky brushes or follow playful story prompts that overlay light "ghost" guides for shapes like rockets, dinosaurs, and dragons.

## Features

- **Two play styles** – swap between Free Drawing and Puzzle prompts that encourage storytelling and shape practice.
- **Kid-friendly tools** – oversized color swatches, brush size slider, undo, and clear canvas controls.
- **Guided prompts** – bright prompts with hints plus on-canvas ghost outlines to inspire shapes and characters.
- **Tablet-ready layout** – landscape default orientation with large touch targets.

## Getting Started

1. Open the project in Android Studio (Giraffe or newer recommended).
2. When prompted, let Android Studio use its bundled Gradle to sync the project.
3. Connect a device or start an emulator.
4. Build and run the `app` module.

To assemble directly from the command line, run:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

> **Note:** If the Gradle wrapper has not downloaded yet, Android Studio will offer to do so automatically the first time you sync the project.

The resulting APK will be located at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

## Requirements

- Android Studio Giraffe (or newer)
- Android SDK 34
- Minimum supported device API 24 (Android 7.0)

Enjoy drawing adventures with the little ones!
